# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies I used the reference period which NASA defined as the period between 1951-1980.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```


```{r tidyweather, echo=FALSE}
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(-c("J-D","D-N","DJF","MAM","JJA","SON")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols="Jan":"Dec", names_to = "Month", values_to = "delta")

tidyweather

```


## Plotting Information


```{r scatter_plot, eval=TRUE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Climate change is real!",
    subtitle = "The graph shows a growing deviation from the 1951 to 1981 reference period",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Delta"
  ) +
  theme_economist()

```


To find out whether the increase in temperature is more pronounced in some months than others, I have used `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. 

```{r facet_wrap}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=year, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather anomalies are evident in all months",
    x = "Year",
    y = ""
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~month, scales = 'free', labeller = 'label_value') +
  theme_clean()
```


```{r intervals, echo=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

I also created a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods I was interested in.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, I have been working with monthly anomalies. However, you might be more interested in average annual anomalies. I can also display these by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`.

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Climate change has been accelerating exponentially since 1960",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  ) +
  theme_clean()


```
