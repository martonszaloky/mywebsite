<h1>GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<p>The GDP data I looked at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. I looked at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compared different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file I worked with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a>.</p>
<p>First I tidied the data, as it is in wide format, so I had to change it to long tidy format. Figures are expressed in billions and indicators were renamed.</p>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;Final consumption expenditure&quot;
