# CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

For the following two graphs I have used the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I used `vroom` to load it and kept `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()
  glimpse(covid_data)

```

I produced two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
2. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

Below you can find both the graphs and the codes used to produce them.


```{r covid_challenge, out.width="100%"}

## Creating graph no. 1 

# Step 1: filtering variables of interest to exclude missing values
covid_death_rate_comorbidities <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'), !age_group %in% c('Unknown', NA), medcond_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>%  

# Step 2: selecting only the four variables needed for this graph 
select(sex,age_group,death_yn,medcond_yn) %>%

# Step 3: grouping the variables since we re interested in the death rate across age group, sex and whether the patient had co-morbities or not
group_by(sex,age_group,medcond_yn) %>% 

# Step 4: calculating the death rate as a percentage value
summarize(death_tot=sum(death_yn=='Yes'),total=n()) %>% 
mutate(death_rate=(death_tot/total*100)) %>%
select(sex,age_group,death_rate,medcond_yn) 

new_labels<-c('Yes'='With Comorbidities','No'='Without Comorbidities')

# Step 5: plotting 
ggplot(covid_death_rate_comorbidities,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
  geom_col(fill='#8b9dc3')+
  facet_grid(medcond_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(medcond_yn=new_labels))+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(2))+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_continuous ()+
  labs(title='Covid death % by age group, sex, and presence of co-morbidities',x='',y='',caption='Source: CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=12))
  
## Creating graph no. 2

# Step 1: filtering variables of interest to exclude missing values
covid_death_rate_icu <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'), !age_group %in% c('Unknown', NA), icu_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>%  

# Step 2: selecting only the four variables needed for this graph 
select(sex,age_group,death_yn,icu_yn) %>%

# Step 3: grouping the variables since we re interested in the death rate across age group, sex and whether the patient had co-morbities or not
group_by(sex,age_group,icu_yn) %>% 

# Step 4: calculating the death rate as a percentage value
summarize(death_tot=sum(death_yn=='Yes'),total=n()) %>% 
mutate(death_rate=(death_tot/total*100)) %>%
select(sex,age_group,death_rate,icu_yn) 

new_labels_ICU<-c('Yes'='Admitted to ICU','No'='No ICU')

# Step 5: plotting 
ggplot(covid_death_rate_icu,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
  geom_col(fill='#ff9984')+
  facet_grid(icu_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(icu_yn=new_labels_ICU))+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(2))+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_continuous ()+
  labs(title='Covid death % by age group, sex, and whether patient was admitted to ICU',x='',y='',caption='Source: CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=12))
