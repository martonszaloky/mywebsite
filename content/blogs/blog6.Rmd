# GDP components over time and among countries

The GDP data I looked at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. I looked at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compared different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file I worked with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6).


```{r read_GDP_data, echo=FALSE}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

First I tidied the data, as it is in wide format, so I had to change it to long tidy format. Figures are expressed in billions and indicators were renamed.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}
UN_GDP_data$IndicatorName %>% unique()

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols="1970":"2017",
    names_to = "year",  
    values_to= "value" 
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    year= year(as.Date(year, "%Y")),
    value = value/(10^9),
    IndicatorName= case_when(
           IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government expenditure",
           IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household expenditure",
           IndicatorName =="Gross capital formation"~"Gross capital formation",
           IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports",
           IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
           IndicatorName == "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables)" ~ "Gross fixed cap formation",
           IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "GDP",
           
           # Not shortening the indicator names that are already short
           TRUE ~ IndicatorName
           
         )
  )



# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```



```{r}
gdp_over_time <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName == c("Gross capital formation", 
                              "Household expenditure",
                              "Imports",
                              "Exports",
                              "Government expenditure"))


gdp_over_time %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value, colour= IndicatorName)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=IndicatorName)) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP components over time",
    subtitle= "In constant 2010 USD",
    y="Billion US$",
    colour= "Components of GDP"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +

    axis.title.x=element_blank()
